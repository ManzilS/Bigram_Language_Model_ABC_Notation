**Bigram Language Model for ABC Music Notation (PyTorch)**

This repository contains an implementation of a bigram language model - it is trained on music in ABC notation! The model is built using PyTorch, one of the leading libraries for deep learning.

**Introduction**

ABC notation is a text-based format for music notation, which has been used for centuries to transcribe folk tunes. In this project, we treat these tunes as "text" and train a language model to generate new music! At its heart, our model is a transformer, a type of architecture that's based on self-attention mechanisms and has been incredibly successful in Natural Language Processing tasks. 

**Features**

- **Bigram Language Model:** The model generates music by predicting the next token (note, chord, or musical symbol) given a context.
- **Transformer Architecture:** The model features a transformer architecture that includes multiple self-attention heads and feed-forward networks.
- **PyTorch Implementation:** PyTorch's flexibility and capacity for effortless computation on both CPUs and GPUs make it an ideal choice for implementing our model.

**How to Use**

First, import the required libraries and define some hyperparameters for the model, such as the size of the vocabulary, the dimensions of the embeddings, the number of attention heads, and the number of layers in the transformer model.

Next, you'll define the various components of the model, including the self-attention heads, the multi-head attention layer, the feed-forward network, and the transformer block.

The main model comprises the embedding layers, the transformer blocks, and the final layer for generating the logits for the next token. During the forward pass of the model, it computes the logits and, if targets are provided, the cross-entropy loss.

Finally, train your model using your ABC notation dataset and watch it compose new pieces!
